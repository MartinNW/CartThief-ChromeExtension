# CartThief-ChromeExtension
The Cart Thief Extension, specifically made for the Chrome web browser.


This Chrome Extension was built to do one thing, <b>get sneakers</b>. 
<br>
I never thought I'd open source this, 
but the market left me with no choice. As of the last build of this extension the sneakers sites that I've automated 
the checkouts for are:  <b>Eastbay</b>, <b>Finishline</b>, <b>Footaction</b>, <b>Adidas</b> and <b>Champs Sports</b>.
<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b>: This will work for General Release sneakers, but will not work for limited releases. Why?
<br>
The competition for these "bots" is pretty high and for high demand releases you'll just get a default page due to the high
amount of users hitting those sneaker pages. 
<br>
If you'd like to contribute to this repo just submit a pull request.

<b>Usage</b>

All the data comes from the <em>background.js</em> file. So fill it out accurately as any wrong data will crash The Cart Thief.
If you'd like to add more sneaker sites just update the <em>manifest.json</em> file.
<br>
<br>
The Countdown timer, is meant to countdown until that particular sneaker launch date. Just set that future date at which they
release in <em>popup.js</em>.
